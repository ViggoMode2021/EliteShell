EliteShell is a Windows desktop application/game designed for users to practice PowerShell cmdlets for Windows and
Windows Server administration and daily tasks. For each correct answer, users receive points that they can use to 'buy'
other PowerShell system administration scripts from GitHub. These solved practice problems, answers, time, date, and points
are stored in a csv file that is created when the user prompts to start a new game. It also contains non-PowerShell practice problems for general IT concepts,
such as the OSI Model and Windows Registry. Currently, the practice concepts are:

- Windows General

- Windows Registry

- Active Directory

- Networking

- DHCP + DNS

2. Solve problems by selecting them from the dropdown and writing the correct PowerShell cmdlet or answer.

3. Track progress by viewing the 'Current Stats:' box on the right side of the screen, or get a more detailed
summary of user progress by going to 'View Score + Stats'.
